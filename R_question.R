# Golden Question

# 2. Using any built-in dataset in R, perform the following tasks:

# Data Manipulation using dplyr:

# Select relevant columns for analysis.
# Filter the dataset based on a meaningful condition.
# Create a new derived column using existing data.
# Group the data and compute summary statistics.
# Arrange the dataset meaningfully (e.g., in ascending or descending order).
# Data Visualization using ggplot2:

# Create at least two visualizations to explore trends or distributions in the dataset
# Use appropriate aesthetics such as color, size, and facets.
# Add clear axis labels, a title, and a legend where necessary.
